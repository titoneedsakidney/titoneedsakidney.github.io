    <section class="testimonial">
      <p>In the beginning days of the COVID-19 pandemic, I had a chance encounter with a co-worker as we were packing up our cubicles in order to start working remotely. It happened that he mentioned that he was looking for a kidney donor, as he had been on dialysis for a few years. As luck would have it, we were the same blood type and it seemed that I might be a potential match.</p>

      <p>The initial testing consisted of blood and urine tests for me and did not rule me out as a potential donor. The next round of testing was non-invasive and included more blood tests, a GFR test and a painless echocardiogram. After a few phone interviews with doctors, my advocate team and a psychological evaluation, the decision was made in October to go ahead with the transplant. Unfortunately, elective surgery was not being scheduled in the early days of the pandemic. However, shortly before Christmas of 2020, we were given a green light and the surgery was scheduled for February of 2021.</p>

      <p>The surgery lasted a few hours and my hospital stay was two nights. I was walking around by the end of the first day. By day two, I was able to get out of bed by myself, shower and walk on my own. I stayed with my brother and his wife for the first week because I needed some assistance with moving and lifting, but I was able to walk a mile by the end of the first week. By week two, I was living on my own again and walking two miles. There was some localized pain for the first few days near the incision but the pain was very well controlled — even without narcotics.</p>

      <p>I was able to return to my office job within two weeks from surgery. Follow-up appointments were roughly at the 1- and 2-week mark, followed by 1, 3, and 6 months, then again at 1 and 2 years.</p>

      <p>My overall recovery was uneventful and I was able to return to all of my normal activities within several weeks (swimming, running, cycling, weight lifting), though intensity and duration was limited at first. Within six months, I was fully recovered with no restrictions. I resumed more aggressive activities such as skiing and mountain biking the following seasons. However, I was told to refrain from high-contact sports due to the increased chance of kidney strikes.</p>

      <p>The only long-term effect is a restriction on NSAIDs such as Advil, though Tylenol is allowable.</p>

      <p>I have never regretted my decision to donate a kidney. I found the experience to be rewarding and extremely worthwhile. The biggest consideration for me as a donor was the potential lost wages for taking time away from work. I was able to use paid time off in my case, though some employers may provide additional time off at no cost to the donor. My donor advocate was very clear from the beginning about expectations and considerations. They were always willing to answer questions and provide a safe environment for me as a donor.</p>

      <p>I would recommend the process to anyone who is able and willing to make a difference in someone's life. It is not simply one life that is changed; all the loved ones of the recipient, their families and their friends all benefit.</p>
