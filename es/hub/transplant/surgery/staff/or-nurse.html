<h1>OR Nurse (Scrub)</h1>

<h2>Short Description</h2>
<p>
  The OR (scrub) nurse keeps the sterile field safe and the operation moving.
  They prepare instruments, anticipate the surgeon’s needs, and help prevent errors.
</p>

<h2>Main Priorities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Set up and maintain the sterile field; ensure correct instruments and supplies are ready.</li>
  <li>Participate in safety checks (“time-out”) for identity, procedure, and site.</li>
  <li>Pass instruments and sutures, handle tissue and specimens correctly, and track implants/stents.</li>
  <li>Count sponges/needles/instruments with the circulating nurse—before, during, and after the case.</li>
  <li>Help with patient positioning and skin prep/draping to protect nerves and skin.</li>
  <li>Watch for breaks in sterility and equipment issues; speak up immediately to keep you safe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issues They Work With</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Breaks in sterility:</strong> detect and correct quickly to avoid infection risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Count mismatches:</strong> resolve with the team before closing.</li>
  <li><strong>Equipment problems:</strong> instrument failure, battery/cord issues, backup set requests.</li>
  <li><strong>Specimen handling:</strong> correct labeling and handoff for pathology/microbiology.</li>
  <li><strong>Positioning/pressure:</strong> padding and re-checks to prevent pressure injuries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Go to Them</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You’ll meet the scrub and circulating nurses in the OR before anesthesia. They confirm your identity, allergies, and procedure.</li>
  <li>During surgery you’re asleep—the scrub nurse works at the sterile field with the surgeon.</li>
  <li>After surgery, your point of contact is the <strong>PACU nurse</strong> and then the <strong>inpatient/transplant unit nurse</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What They Don’t Handle (Boundaries)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>They don’t manage long-term medicines or clinic follow-up—your transplant providers do.</li>
  <li>They don’t handle scheduling, refills, or insurance forms—coordinators and the floor team handle those.</li>
  <li>They don’t provide post-op phone triage—use your clinic’s on-call process.</li>
</ul>

<p class="disclaimer">Informational only; titles vary by hospital. In some centers, a scrub technologist shares these tasks with or instead of a scrub nurse.</p>
