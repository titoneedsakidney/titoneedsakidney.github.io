    <h1>About Tito</h1>

      <p>
        Hi, Iâ€™m Titoâ€”a two-time kidney transplant recipient. Iâ€™ve been through dialysis,
        surgeries, and the long road to recovery. This site is where I share what I wish
        I had known: honest stories, helpful resources, and practical tips for navigating
        kidney disease and transplant life.

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My story started when I was diagnosed with kidney failure and began dialysis.
        After two transplants and countless lessons along the way, Iâ€™ve learned how
        important it is to have clear information and real support. This site combines
        my personal experience with what Iâ€™ve learned from others in the kidney community.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
      <p>
        When I was going through dialysis and transplant, I often felt overwhelmed and
        alone. I created Tito Needs a Kidney to help others avoid that feelingâ€”whether
        youâ€™re a patient, donor, or caregiver. Here youâ€™ll find knowledge hubs,
        testimonials, and step-by-step guides designed to make a tough journey
        a little easier.

      <p>
        My book <em>"Tito Needs a Kidney"</em> goes deeper into the ups and downs of my
        experienceâ€”from life on dialysis to finally getting a transplant.
