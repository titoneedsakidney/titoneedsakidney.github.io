    <h1>About Tito</h1>
    
    <section class="callout">
      <p>
        Hi, I‚Äôm Tito‚Äîa two-time kidney transplant recipient. I‚Äôve been through dialysis,
        surgeries, and the long road to recovery. This site is where I share what I wish
        I had known: honest stories, helpful resources, and practical tips for navigating
        kidney disease and transplant life.
      </p>

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My story started when I was diagnosed with kidney failure and began dialysis.
        After two transplants and countless lessons along the way, I‚Äôve learned how
        important it is to have clear information and real support. This site combines
        my personal experience with what I‚Äôve learned from others in the kidney community.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
      <p>
        When I was going through dialysis and transplant, I often felt overwhelmed and
        alone. I created Tito Needs a Kidney to help others avoid that feeling‚Äîwhether
        you‚Äôre a patient, donor, or caregiver. Here you‚Äôll find knowledge hubs,
        testimonials, and step-by-step guides designed to make a tough journey
        a little easier.
      </p>

      <p>
        My book <em>"Tito Needs a Kidney"</em> goes deeper into the ups and downs of my
        experience‚Äîfrom life on dialysis to finally getting a transplant.
