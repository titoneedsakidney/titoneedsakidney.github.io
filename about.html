    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Tito. I’ve been a wine judge, a field service engineer, and a patient fighting for his life — sometimes all at the same time.</p>

    <p>I was diagnosed with kidney disease in my twenties, after a kidney stone and a routine checkup led to a diagnosis I never expected: IgA nephropathy. It slowly wrecked my kidneys until I needed dialysis to stay alive. I’ve since gone through more than 300 dialysis treatments, two kidney transplants, and eight surgeries. One transplant was from a living donor — my uncle. It worked for six weeks. The second came from a deceased donor. It’s still working, and I’m doing everything I can to protect it.</p>

    <p>Before all of this, I was traveling over 50 times a year for work, competing in ballroom dance, and making wine that won national awards. I still do some of that when I can — but now, most of my time is focused on recovery, resilience, and helping others through what I’ve already been through.</p>

    <p>This site is my way of paying it forward. Whether you’re living with kidney disease, supporting someone who is, or just curious about becoming a donor — I hope something here helps you feel a little less overwhelmed and a little more equipped.</p>

    <p>If you want to know what it’s really like to live through this, I’ve written about it honestly — the good, the painful, and the absurd. My book <em>Tito Needs a Kidney</em> is available now, and I’m building out tools and resources to make this road easier for others.</p>

    <p>Thanks for being here. You’re already making a difference.</p>
