      <h1>Common Side Effects of Dialysis</h1>

      <p>
        Dialysis is lifesaving — but it can come with side effects. Understanding what’s normal and what’s not can help you stay ahead of issues and advocate for your care.
      </p>

      <h2>🌀 Fatigue</h2>
      <p>
        Feeling wiped out after a session is common, especially if you lost a lot of fluid or had a crash. Try not to schedule major activities right after dialysis if you can help it.
      </p>

      <h2>😵 Low Blood Pressure (Hypotension)</h2>
      <p>
        Symptoms include dizziness, nausea, muscle cramping, or even temporary vision or hearing loss. Caused by pulling too much fluid too fast. Let your team know if this keeps happening — your dry weight or treatment time may need adjusting.
      </p>

      <h2>💢 Muscle Cramps</h2>
      <p>
        Sudden painful cramps, usually in the legs or feet, can happen during or after treatment. Often linked to fluid shifts or electrolyte changes.
      </p>

      <h2>💉 Access Site Pain or Infection</h2>
      <p>
        Redness, swelling, warmth, or drainage near your catheter or fistula may be signs of infection. Don’t ignore this — it can escalate fast.
      </p>

      <h2>💊 Itching or Restless Legs</h2>
      <p>
        Dry skin or buildup of waste products between sessions can cause intense itching. Restless legs are also common, especially at night.
      </p>

      <h2>🧠 Brain Fog</h2>
      <p>
        Trouble concentrating, forgetfulness, or “dialysis hangover” is real. If it’s affecting daily life, bring it up with your team.
      </p>

      <h2>😔 Emotional Effects</h2>
      <p>
        Depression and anxiety are common and valid responses to life on dialysis. Social workers and peer support groups can help — you don’t have to tough it out alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not every symptom means something is wrong, but nothing should be dismissed. Keep track of patterns and speak up when something feels off.
