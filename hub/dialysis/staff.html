      <h1>Dialysis Staff & Roles</h1>

      <p>
        Dialysis centers are busy places with many people working behind the scenes to keep you safe and stable. Here’s a guide to who does what and when to speak to them.
      </p>

      <h2>📋 Dialysis Technician</h2>
      <p>
        The tech sets up your machine, inserts the needles (if you’re using a fistula or graft), monitors the session, and helps troubleshoot alarms. They’re often your most frequent point of contact during treatments.
      </p>

      <h2>💉 Dialysis Nurse (RN)</h2>
      <p>
        The nurse oversees all treatments on the floor. They handle assessments, medications, iron, injections, and emergencies. If you feel sick during treatment or your blood pressure crashes, the nurse steps in.
      </p>

      <h2>🩺 Nephrologist</h2>
      <p>
        Your kidney doctor visits monthly to review labs, adjust prescriptions, and assess your treatment plan. They usually do rounds during your session. You may only see them for a few minutes each visit — write down questions ahead of time.
      </p>

      <h2>🗂️ Social Worker</h2>
      <p>
        Available to help with insurance, transportation, disability paperwork, and emotional support. Often underutilized but extremely helpful if you're struggling with life outside the clinic.
      </p>

      <h2>🍽️ Dietitian</h2>
      <p>
        Reviews your monthly labs and helps manage phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and fluid intake. Can explain food substitutions and suggest supplements when needed.
      </p>

      <h2>🏢 Clinic Administrator</h2>
      <p>
        Manages the overall operations. You’ll rarely interact with them, but they handle staffing, policies, and facility issues.
      </p>

      <h2>💬 Who to Talk To (When You Need Help)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Needle placement issues:</strong> Tech or nurse</li>
        <li><strong>Low blood pressure or cramps:</strong> Nurse</li>
        <li><strong>Confusion about meds or labs:</strong> Nurse or nephrologist</li>
        <li><strong>Food questions:</strong> Dietitian</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance or time-off work:</strong> Social worker</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment or cleanliness issues:</strong> Nurse or administrator</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Understanding the roles helps you get better care — and avoids delays when something’s wrong.
