      <h1>What to Expect During Dialysis</h1>

      <p>
        Starting dialysis can be overwhelming. Here’s what a typical in-center hemodialysis day looks like, so you know what to expect.
      </p>

      <h2>Arrival & Check-In</h2>
      <p>
        You’ll arrive at your scheduled time and check in at the front desk. A tech will weigh you and take your temperature, blood pressure, and other vitals.
      </p>

      <h2>Setup & Needle Insertion</h2>
      <p>
        A dialysis nurse or technician will prep your access site — cleaning it and inserting the needles (or connecting the catheter). This part can be uncomfortable, especially early on.
      </p>

      <h2>Treatment Time</h2>
      <p>
        Hemodialysis usually takes about 3.5 to 4 hours. You’ll sit in a recliner with your blood cycling through the machine. Most centers provide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>TVs or tablets for entertainment</li>
        <li>Blankets (but you can bring your own)</li>
        <li>Limited snacks or drinks, depending on policy</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>After Dialysis</h2>
      <p>
        Once the session ends, the nurse or tech will remove the needles and stop any bleeding. You’ll be weighed again, and your post-dialysis vitals will be recorded.
      </p>

      <h2>How You Might Feel</h2>
      <p>
        It’s common to feel tired, cold, or lightheaded after treatment. Some people need a nap, others bounce back quickly. Stay hydrated and watch for cramps or headaches — those may signal too much fluid was removed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, you’ll get used to the process. Every center runs a little differently, but most follow the same structure. Ask questions. Speak up if something doesn’t feel right.
