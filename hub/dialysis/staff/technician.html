      <h1>Dialysis Technician / Patient Care Technician (PCT)</h1>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>
        Dialysis Technicians, often called Patient Care Technicians (PCTs), are the frontline staff who set up your machine,
        start and end your treatments, and monitor your safety throughout the session. They work closely with nurses to make
        sure each treatment is done correctly.
      </p>

      <h2>Main Priorities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prepare and test the dialysis machine before use.</li>
        <li>Safely connect and disconnect patients from treatment.</li>
        <li>Monitor blood pressure, pulse, and other vital signs.</li>
        <li>Watch for complications during treatment and alert the nurse when needed.</li>
        <li>Keep treatment areas clean and stocked.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Issues They Work With</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Problems with needles, fistulas, or grafts during hookup.</li>
        <li>Adjusting your position, arm supports, or lines to stay comfortable.</li>
        <li>Responding to alarms from the machine.</li>
        <li>Noticing and reporting sudden changes in blood pressure or symptoms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Go to Them</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>At the start or end of treatment to report any new pain, swelling, or access concerns.</li>
        <li>If you feel dizzy, short of breath, crampy, or otherwise unwell during treatment.</li>
        <li>If your machine alarms and they haven’t seen it yet.</li>
        <li>For small adjustments to your setup during a run.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What They Don’t Handle (Boundaries)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Changing your dialysis prescription (treatment time, fluid goal, dialyzer type) — that must come from
          the nurse or nephrologist.
        </li>
        <li>Making medical diagnoses.</li>
        <li>Approving changes to your medication list.</li>
      </ul>
    </main>
