      <h1>Nephrologist</h1>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>
        A nephrologist is a doctor who specializes in kidney care. They are responsible for your overall dialysis
        prescription, long-term treatment plan, and medical decisions related to your kidney disease.
      </p>

      <h2>Main Priorities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Diagnose and manage kidney disease and related conditions.</li>
        <li>Set and update your dialysis prescription (treatment time, frequency, fluid goals, dialyzer type).</li>
        <li>Monitor lab results and adjust medications accordingly.</li>
        <li>Coordinate care with other specialists, such as cardiologists or surgeons.</li>
        <li>Provide medical clearance for procedures or surgeries when needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Issues They Work With</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ongoing kidney-related health problems.</li>
        <li>Complications from dialysis, such as anemia, bone disease, or electrolyte imbalances.</li>
        <li>Deciding when to adjust dialysis parameters for better results.</li>
        <li>Evaluating you for transplant referral or follow-up.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Go to Them</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>During scheduled clinic rounds for questions about your treatment plan.</li>
        <li>If you want to discuss changes to dialysis frequency or goals.</li>
        <li>For concerns about ongoing symptoms that persist between treatments.</li>
        <li>When you need medical documentation for another provider or insurance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What They Donâ€™t Handle (Boundaries)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Day-to-day scheduling, transportation, or insurance matters.</li>
        <li>On-the-spot equipment troubleshooting; technicians and nurses handle that.</li>
        <li>Diet counseling beyond basic medical guidance; detailed plans come from the dietitian.</li>
      </ul>
    </main>
