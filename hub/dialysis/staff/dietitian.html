      <h1>Dietitian</h1>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>
        The dialysis dietitian is a nutrition expert who helps you manage your diet to control fluid, potassium,
        phosphorus, sodium, and protein levels. They work closely with your medical team to adjust your nutrition
        plan based on your labs and treatment goals.
      </p>

      <h2>Main Priorities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review lab results and adjust your diet recommendations accordingly.</li>
        <li>Teach you how to meet protein needs while controlling fluid and mineral intake.</li>
        <li>Suggest food swaps to keep meals enjoyable while staying within restrictions.</li>
        <li>Help prevent malnutrition and maintain a healthy weight during dialysis.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Issues They Work With</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>High or low potassium and phosphorus levels.</li>
        <li>Low albumin or signs of malnutrition.</li>
        <li>Difficulty managing thirst or fluid restriction.</li>
        <li>Planning meals that fit medical restrictions, budget, and personal preferences.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Go to Them</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If your labs show repeated issues with potassium, phosphorus, or albumin.</li>
        <li>When you are struggling to stick to fluid or sodium limits.</li>
        <li>If you lose or gain weight unexpectedly.</li>
        <li>To discuss new foods, supplements, or changes in your eating habits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What They Donâ€™t Handle (Boundaries)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prescribing medications or supplements without doctor approval.</li>
        <li>Changing your dialysis prescription.</li>
        <li>Handling insurance coverage for food or supplements - that goes to the financial coordinator.</li>
      </ul>
    </main>
