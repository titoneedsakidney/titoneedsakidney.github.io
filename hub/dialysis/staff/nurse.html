      <h1>Dialysis Nurse (RN)</h1>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>
        Dialysis nurses are registered nurses who oversee your care during treatments.
        They coordinate with the nephrologist, supervise technicians, and handle any
        medical issues that arise in the clinic.
      </p>

      <h2>Main Priorities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review your health status before treatment and adjust care as needed.</li>
        <li>Give IV medications such as iron, antibiotics, or anticoagulants.</li>
        <li>Monitor your response to treatment and address urgent health changes.</li>
        <li>Educate patients on dialysis care, diet, and medications.</li>
        <li>Supervise and support the work of dialysis technicians.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Issues They Work With</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Blood pressure drops, cramping, chest pain, or shortness of breath during treatment.</li>
        <li>Concerns about your vascular access, such as swelling, redness, or signs of infection.</li>
        <li>Questions about lab results or changes in your health between nephrologist visits.</li>
        <li>Clarifying the dialysis prescription and explaining any adjustments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Go to Them</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have sudden symptoms during dialysis.</li>
        <li>For clarification about treatment orders or recent lab results.</li>
        <li>If you notice changes to your access site between sessions.</li>
        <li>When your technician refers an issue to the nurse for medical review.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What They Don’t Handle (Boundaries)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Changing your long-term dialysis plan without nephrologist approval.</li>
        <li>Authorizing non-dialysis prescriptions or treatments outside their scope.</li>
        <li>Handling insurance or billing questions — those go to the financial coordinator.</li>
      </ul>
