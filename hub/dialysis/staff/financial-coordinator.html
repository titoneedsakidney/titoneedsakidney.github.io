      <h1>Financial Coordinator</h1>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>
        The financial coordinator helps you navigate the costs of dialysis, including insurance coverage,
        assistance programs, and billing questions. They work to reduce your out-of-pocket expenses and connect
        you to available financial resources.
      </p>

      <h2>Main Priorities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Verify insurance coverage for dialysis treatments, lab work, and medications.</li>
        <li>Explain Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance benefits.</li>
        <li>Assist with applications for financial aid programs and grants.</li>
        <li>Resolve billing errors and coordinate payment plans if needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Issues They Work With</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding your insurance benefits and what’s covered.</li>
        <li>Questions about Medicare eligibility for dialysis patients.</li>
        <li>Applying for medication assistance or copay help.</li>
        <li>Addressing unexpected or incorrect bills from the clinic.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Go to Them</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you receive a bill you don’t understand.</li>
        <li>Before starting a new insurance plan to check dialysis coverage.</li>
        <li>When you lose insurance or have a major change in your coverage.</li>
        <li>If you need help applying for financial assistance programs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What They Don’t Handle (Boundaries)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Changing your dialysis prescription or treatment schedule.</li>
        <li>Approving medical procedures — that requires your nephrologist’s order.</li>
        <li>Arranging transportation or non-financial services — that’s handled by the social worker or patient services coordinator.</li>
      </ul>
    </main>
