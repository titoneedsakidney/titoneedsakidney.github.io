      <h1>Floor Supervisor / Charge Nurse</h1>

      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>
        The floor supervisor, often called the charge nurse, oversees all patient care during a shift.
        They coordinate staff assignments, handle emergencies, and ensure treatments follow clinic
        policies and medical orders.
      </p>

      <h2>Main Priorities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Supervise the nursing and technician team during the shift.</li>
        <li>Respond to urgent medical situations or treatment complications.</li>
        <li>Ensure each patient’s dialysis prescription is followed correctly.</li>
        <li>Manage staffing needs and patient flow for the day.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Issues They Work With</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Emergency medical situations during treatment.</li>
        <li>Escalated patient concerns that the assigned nurse or technician can’t resolve.</li>
        <li>Decisions about temporarily adjusting care in unusual situations.</li>
        <li>Coordinating care when a patient needs to transfer to another unit or hospital.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Go to Them</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have an urgent concern that isn’t being addressed by your assigned nurse or technician.</li>
        <li>For questions about how your care is being coordinated during that shift.</li>
        <li>If you experience a serious or worsening medical issue during dialysis.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What They Don’t Handle (Boundaries)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Long-term changes to your treatment plan — those must be made by your nephrologist.</li>
        <li>Scheduling, billing, or insurance matters.</li>
        <li>Non-urgent concerns that can be handled by your regular nurse or technician.</li>
      </ul>
