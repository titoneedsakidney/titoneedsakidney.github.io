      <h1>Dialysis Access Options</h1>
      <p>
        There are two main types of vascular access used for hemodialysis: <strong>catheters</strong> and <strong>fistulas</strong>. Some people may also have a graft, which is less common.
      </p>

      <h2>Catheters</h2>
      <p>
        Catheters are flexible tubes inserted into a large vein, usually in the chest. They’re often used when dialysis needs to begin quickly.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quick to place, used for short-term access</li>
        <li>Higher risk of infection and clotting</li>
        <li>Requires special care and cleaning</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fistulas</h2>
      <p>
        A fistula is a connection made between an artery and a vein, usually in the arm. It takes a few months to heal but is the preferred access for long-term dialysis.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower infection risk</li>
        <li>Lasts longer than a catheter</li>
        <li>Needs time to "mature" before use</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Grafts</h2>
      <p>
        A graft uses a soft tube to connect an artery to a vein. It’s used when veins aren’t suitable for a fistula.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Used when veins are too small or damaged</li>
        <li>Heals faster than a fistula</li>
        <li>Higher complication rate than a fistula</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The best access depends on your health, vein quality, and how urgently dialysis is needed.
