<h1>Hemodialysis Access: Catheter, Fistula, Graft</h1>
<p>
  Hemodialysis needs a reliable way to move blood in and out. You’ll hear about three options:
  a <strong>catheter</strong> (temporary), a <strong>fistula</strong> (preferred long-term), or a <strong>graft</strong> (when veins aren’t ideal).
  Peritoneal dialysis uses a different access (abdominal catheter) and isn’t covered here.
</p>

<h2>Quick compare</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Catheter (neck/chest):</strong> fastest to use; highest infection/clot risk; for urgent starts or while a permanent access heals.</li>
  <li><strong>Fistula (AVF):</strong> artery joined to a vein in the arm; lowest infection risk; can last years; takes time to “mature.”</li>
  <li><strong>Graft (AVG):</strong> soft synthetic tube joining artery to vein; ready sooner than a fistula; more stenosis/infection than AVF.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Catheters</h2>
<p>
  Flexible tubes placed in a large vein (often chest). Common when dialysis must start now.
  Some are temporary (ICU/neck); most outpatient lines are <em>tunneled</em> with cuffs to reduce infection.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> can use immediately; no needles.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> higher infection and clot risk; lower blood flows; can limit showers and activities.</li>
  <li><strong>Care:</strong> keep dressing clean/dry; no submerging (pools, tubs); avoid tugging; never flush at home.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal:</strong> plan a fistula or graft ASAP so the catheter can be removed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fistulas (AVF)</h2>
<p>
  A small outpatient surgery connects an artery to a vein—usually in the forearm or upper arm. Over weeks, the vein gets thicker and easier to use.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> often 6–12 weeks to mature (varies). Your team will check size/flow before first cannulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Daily check:</strong> feel a gentle <em>vibration</em> (thrill) over the fistula. Call if it’s weak or gone.</li>
  <li><strong>Protect the arm:</strong> no blood pressure, IVs, tight watches/jewelry, or heavy lifting until cleared.</li>
  <li><strong>During treatment:</strong> needle techniques include rope-ladder or buttonhole (center policy varies).</li>
  <li><strong>Watch for:</strong> prolonged bleeding after needle removal, bulging areas that keep growing, numb/cold fingers, hand pain with use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grafts (AVG)</h2>
<p>
  A soft synthetic tube connects an artery to a vein—useful when veins are too small/damaged for a fistula.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> often ready in ~2–4 weeks (surgeon confirms).</li>
  <li><strong>Care:</strong> same arm protections as a fistula; avoid pressure over the graft.</li>
  <li><strong>Watch for:</strong> redness, warmth, tender lumps, prolonged bleeding, or new high-pitched “whistling” sound (may signal narrowing).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choosing & timeline</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Urgent start:</strong> catheter now, plan fistula (first choice) or graft as soon as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Planned start:</strong> vein mapping ultrasound → fistula if feasible; graft if not.</li>
  <li><strong>After creation:</strong> you may get hand/forearm exercises to help a fistula mature—follow your surgeon’s guidance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Access care basics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep skin clean; follow dressing instructions. Don’t scratch scabs at needle sites.</li>
  <li>Warm the arm before cannulation (per clinic routine) to help veins open up.</li>
  <li>After treatment, hold gentle pressure—don’t peek. Report bleeding that won’t stop.</li>
  <li>Sleep with the access arm uncrowded—no body weight on it; avoid tight sleeves.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to call</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Right away:</strong> fever/chills, spreading redness, pus, foul odor, or sudden loss of thrill (fistula/graft).</li>
  <li><strong>Soon:</strong> new severe hand pain, cold/numb fingers, prolonged bleeding (&gt;20 minutes), swelling that’s getting worse, or a catheter dressing that gets soaked or pulled loose.</li>
</ul>

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong> Which access is best for me and why? What’s my target timeline? How will we check if the fistula/graft is ready? What are my “call now” signs?</p>
