      <h1>Dialysis Schedule & Timing</h1>

      <p>
        In-center hemodialysis typically happens three times a week â€” either Monday-Wednesday-Friday or Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday. Each session lasts about 3.5 to 4 hours, not including setup and recovery time.
      </p>

      <h2>Session Start Times</h2>
      <p>
        Clinics often have multiple shifts starting as early as 5 or 6 a.m. and ending in the evening. Youâ€™ll be assigned a regular shift and expected to arrive on time every time.
      </p>

      <h2>Rescheduling</h2>
      <p>
        Most centers require at least 24-hour notice for any missed or rescheduled appointments. Missing treatments can seriously affect your health â€” toxins and fluid build up quickly.
      </p>

      <h2>Other Scheduling Considerations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>ðŸ’§ <strong>Fluid intake:</strong> Between treatments, fluid builds up in your body. Going more than 2 days without dialysis (like over a weekend) often means more fluid to remove, which can lead to cramps or low blood pressure.</li>
        <li>ðŸ’‰ <strong>Lab work:</strong> Monthly labs are often drawn before your session. Sometimes this affects the start time or prep.</li>
        <li>ðŸ§¾ <strong>Doctor visits:</strong> Nephrologists often do quick rounds at the clinic â€” usually monthly â€” during your treatment time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips for Managing Your Time</h2>
      <p>
        Plan for about 5â€“6 hours total door-to-door. Many people bring books, headphones, or small projects. Tell work or caregivers your schedule in advance. Dialysis becomes part of your weekly routine â€” itâ€™s demanding, but predictable.
