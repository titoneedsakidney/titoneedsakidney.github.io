<h1>Transplant Nephrologist</h1>

<h2>Short Description</h2>
<p>
  A transplant nephrologist is the kidney specialist who leads your medical work-up before surgery. 
  They review tests, confirm that transplant is safe, and tune your plan alongside the rest of the team.
</p>

<h2>Main Priorities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Review labs, heart/lung testing, and infection screening for surgical readiness.</li>
  <li>Explain benefits/risks and how your risks will be reduced.</li>
  <li>Coordinate timing with dialysis (if applicable) and other specialists.</li>
  <li>Optimize blood pressure, diabetes control, anemia, and bone/mineral balance.</li>
  <li>Plan vaccinations and medication adjustments before surgery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issues They Work With</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Abnormal labs (electrolytes, creatinine trends) and what to repeat or confirm.</li>
  <li>Heart or lung findings that may need more testing before clearance.</li>
  <li>Infection risks that must be treated or ruled out prior to surgery.</li>
  <li>Questions about matching, crossmatch results, and what they mean for you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Go to Them</h2>
<ul>
  <li>During the evaluation visits and any time your health changes (ER visit, new infection, hospitalization).</li>
  <li>If you have new symptoms (fever, chest pain, shortness of breath) or big BP/weight swings.</li>
  <li>To review what’s still pending for clearance and how close you are to “ready.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>What They Don’t Handle (Boundaries)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Insurance approvals and cost estimates — handled by the financial coordinator.</li>
  <li>Scheduling tests and logistics — coordinated by the transplant coordinator.</li>
  <li>Surgical approach and incision details — explained by the transplant surgeon.</li>
</ul>
