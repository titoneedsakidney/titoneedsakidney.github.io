<h1>Social Worker</h1>

<h2>Short Description</h2>
<p>
  The social worker helps you and your caregiver prepare for surgery and the weeks after.
  They focus on coping, practical planning, and connecting you with resources.
</p>

<h2>Main Priorities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Build a realistic caregiver plan (rides, help at home, backups).</li>
  <li>Screen for stress, anxiety, depression, and substance use; offer tools and referrals.</li>
  <li>Guide work/benefits paperwork (FMLA, disability) and clinic documentation needs.</li>
  <li>Connect you with transportation, lodging, and community support resources.</li>
  <li>Teach what to expect emotionally before and after surgery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issues They Work With</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Caregiver burnout risk, family conflict, or limited support at home.</li>
  <li>Practical barriers to appointments (childcare, distance, time off).</li>
  <li>Financial stress that impacts adherence (they coordinate with finance as needed).</li>
  <li>Grief, fear, or past trauma that may flare around surgery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Go to Them</h2>
<ul>
  <li>During evaluation to set up support plans and review resources.</li>
  <li>When stress or logistics could delay surgery or follow-up.</li>
  <li>Any time forms, employer letters, or school notes are needed.</li>
  <li>If you or your caregiver feel overwhelmed and need rapid support.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What They Don’t Handle (Boundaries)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Medical decisions or medication changes — handled by the clinical team.</li>
  <li>Insurance authorizations and cost estimates — financial coordinator.</li>
  <li>Emergency mental health care — use your center’s urgent process or 911.</li>
</ul>
