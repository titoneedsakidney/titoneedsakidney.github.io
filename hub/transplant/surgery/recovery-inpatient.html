<h1>In-Hospital Recovery</h1>
<p>
  The first 2–4 days focus on pain control, steady fluids and blood pressure, early walking, and
  learning your new medication routine. Plans vary by center and by how quickly the kidney “wakes up.”
</p>

<h2>First 24–72 hours: what to expect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PACU → surgical floor:</strong> you wake in recovery, then move to your room when stable.</li>
  <li><strong>Vitals & labs:</strong> blood pressure, urine output, and creatinine are checked closely.</li>
  <li><strong>Walking:</strong> first walk the day of/after surgery with help; several short walks daily.</li>
  <li><strong>Breathing:</strong> use the incentive spirometer every hour when awake; leg pumps (SCDs) help prevent clots.</li>
  <li><strong>Eating:</strong> start with sips/ice → clear liquids → light food as nausea settles and bowel sounds return.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lines & devices you may have</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Foley catheter:</strong> drains urine; commonly removed in a few days once output is steady.</li>
  <li><strong>Ureteral stent (internal):</strong> protects the bladder connection; removed later in clinic (often 2–6 weeks).</li>
  <li><strong>IV lines:</strong> for fluids and medicines; sometimes an arterial line for close BP checks.</li>
  <li><strong>JP drain (bulb):</strong> not always used; collects fluid near the incision. Nurses will empty and measure output; removal when output is low and light.</li>
  <li><strong>Wound vacuum:</strong> occasionally used to support healing if the incision needs help. Staff manage dressing changes and pump alarms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pain, nausea, bowels</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pain plan:</strong> multimodal (several methods together). Tell staff early if pain is building.</li>
  <li><strong>Nausea:</strong> anti-nausea meds are available—ask so you can keep medicines down.</li>
  <li><strong>Bowels:</strong> stool softeners and early walking prevent constipation; gas pain is common and improves with movement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fluids, blood pressure, and the kidney</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fluids are adjusted to support the graft; blood pressure targets are set by your team.</li>
  <li><strong>Delayed graft function:</strong> sometimes the kidney is slow to start, especially with deceased-donor kidneys. Short-term dialysis can be needed while recovery continues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Medications & teaching</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First doses of anti-rejection medicines often start around surgery day. Nurses/pharmacists will review names, timing, and side effects.</li>
  <li>Before discharge you’ll do a “teach-back” (show you can take meds correctly) and get a written schedule. Ask about trough labs drawn <em>before</em> morning doses after you’re home.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Incision care & activity in the hospital</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep the incision clean and dry; staff will change dressings. Tell them about spreading redness, warmth, foul odor, or new drainage.</li>
  <li>Walk the hall 3–5 times/day as able. No lifting heavier than a gallon of milk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visitors & sleep</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Short, quiet visits help; skip visits if you’re wiped out. Hand hygiene for everyone.</li>
  <li>Hospitals are noisy—earplugs/eye mask help. Short naps are fine; try for a consistent bedtime.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discharge checklist</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pain controlled on pills; able to walk to the bathroom and hallway with assistance as needed.</li>
  <li>Eating/drinking without vomiting; bowel function returning.</li>
  <li>Clear <strong>med schedule</strong> (names, doses, exact times) and first <strong>lab/clinic</strong> dates.</li>
  <li>Wound care instructions; Foley/JP/wound-vac plans and who to call for problems.</li>
  <li>Pharmacy picked; refills and prior authorizations started.</li>
</ul>

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>Ask each day:</strong> What are today’s goals (walks, labs, lines coming out)? What’s my discharge target date? When is my first clinic and lab after discharge?</p>
