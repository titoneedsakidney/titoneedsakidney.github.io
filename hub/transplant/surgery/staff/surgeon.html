<h1>Transplant Surgeon</h1>

<h2>Short Description</h2>
<p>
  The transplant surgeon performs the operation, connects the new kidney to your blood vessels and bladder,
  controls bleeding, and manages any surgical issues during the hospital stay.
</p>

<h2>Main Priorities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Plan and perform the operation safely (incision, exposure, handling scar tissue).</li>
  <li>Connect artery/vein to pelvic vessels so blood flows through the kidney.</li>
  <li>Attach the ureter to the bladder; place a temporary internal stent when needed.</li>
  <li>Decide on drains (JP) or a wound vacuum and set removal criteria.</li>
  <li>Control bleeding, prevent clots, and protect the bladder connection (no excess tension).</li>
  <li>Set early activity limits and coordinate pain control with anesthesia and the inpatient team.</li>
  <li>Update family after surgery and when you’re settled in recovery or your room.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issues They Work With</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Complex anatomy or prior abdominal surgeries that change the approach.</li>
  <li>Bleeding, hematoma, or need to return to the OR if bleeding persists.</li>
  <li>Urine leak or ureteral narrowing (may require stent/exchange or procedure).</li>
  <li>Fluid collections near the kidney (seroma/lymphocele) that sometimes need drainage.</li>
  <li>Wound problems and incisional/inguinal hernias.</li>
  <li>Delayed graft function—they coordinate with the medical team if dialysis is needed short term.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Go to Them</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pre-op consult:</strong> get incision/approach details, device plans (stent, JP, wound vac), and specific risks for you.</li>
  <li><strong>In hospital:</strong> questions about lines/drains, incision concerns, or if pain/swelling worsens around the surgical site.</li>
  <li><strong>After discharge:</strong> new or worsening redness, drainage, bulge at the incision, persistent fluid from a drain, or trouble after stent removal—contact the transplant team; the surgeon’s group will be looped in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What They Don’t Handle (Boundaries)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Long-term medication dosing or lab-by-lab immunosuppression changes — nephrologist/pharmacist manage this.</li>
  <li>Routine refills, day-to-day scheduling, and forms — coordinator/social worker/clinic handle these.</li>
  <li>Non-surgical symptoms (fever, blood pressure, electrolytes) — call the transplant clinic; they will route as needed.</li>
  <li>Emergencies (severe chest pain, breathing trouble, heavy bleeding) — use on-call instructions or 911.</li>
</ul>

<p class="disclaimer">Informational only; roles vary by center. Follow your surgical team’s specific instructions.</p>
