<h1>Anesthesiologist</h1>

<h2>Short Description</h2>
<p>
  The anesthesiologist keeps you safely asleep and pain-controlled during surgery. They manage your airway,
  breathing, blood pressure, fluids, temperature, and nausea prevention so the new kidney has the best start.
</p>

<h2>Main Priorities</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>General anesthesia:</strong> place a breathing tube, monitor oxygen and heart rhythm, and keep you fully asleep and pain-free.</li>
  <li><strong>Blood pressure & fluids:</strong> maintain targets and give fluids/medicines so blood flow to the kidney stays steady.</li>
  <li><strong>Lines & monitoring:</strong> start IVs; sometimes place an arterial line for close blood-pressure tracking.</li>
  <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> use warmers to prevent getting cold (hypothermia slows healing and can raise risks).</li>
  <li><strong>Pain & nausea plan:</strong> multimodal pain control and anti-nausea medicines during and after surgery.</li>
  <li><strong>Safe wake-up:</strong> remove the breathing tube when you’re ready and hand off to the PACU team with a clear plan.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issues They Work With</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Airway:</strong> prior neck/jaw problems, sleep apnea, or dental issues (loose teeth, bridges) that affect intubation.</li>
  <li><strong>Nausea risk:</strong> past post-op nausea/vomiting (PONV), motion sickness—extra prevention can be given.</li>
  <li><strong>Blood pressure swings:</strong> treat lows/highs quickly to protect the kidney and your heart/brain.</li>
  <li><strong>Pain control:</strong> adjust meds; some centers add numbing blocks near the incision when appropriate.</li>
  <li><strong>IV access:</strong> difficult veins, prior fistulas/grafts to avoid, or need for additional monitoring lines.</li>
  <li><strong>Allergies & reactions:</strong> antibiotic or latex allergy, prior anesthesia problems—plan is tailored.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Go to Them</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pre-op visit or call:</strong> review health history, prior anesthesia experiences, medicines, and fasting instructions.</li>
  <li><strong>Day of surgery:</strong> confirm last food/drink time, last dialysis date/time (if applicable), and morning meds you took/held.</li>
  <li><strong>Bring/tell:</strong> medication list with exact times, CPAP machine (if you use one), allergies, dental issues, past nausea or difficult airways, and any heart/lung problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What They Don’t Handle (Boundaries)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>They don’t set your long-term transplant medicines or clinic follow-up—your transplant team does.</li>
  <li>They don’t manage insurance, refills, or forms—coordinators and the inpatient team handle those.</li>
  <li>After you leave the recovery room, your first contact is the inpatient/transplant unit nurse; they loop in anesthesia if needed.</li>
</ul>
