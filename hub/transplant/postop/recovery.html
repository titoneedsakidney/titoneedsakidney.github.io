<h1>Post-Op: Recovery</h1>
<p>Recovery is individual. Most people go home in 2–4 days, feel steadier by week 2, and rebuild strength over the next few months.</p>

<h2>What the first 6 weeks usually look like</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hospital (days 1–4):</strong> walking the day of/after surgery, pain control, urine and labs watched closely.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 1–2:</strong> expect fatigue. Short walks daily. No tub baths, pools, or hot tubs until incisions fully closed.</li>
  <li><strong>Weeks 3–6:</strong> walking > 30 minutes most days; light chores. Many return to desk work by 2–4 weeks; physical jobs can take 4–8+ weeks with clearance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Medications &amp; labs</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Take anti-rejection meds exactly on time.</strong> Set alarms; do not double up if you miss—call your team.</li>
  <li><strong>Lab schedule:</strong> very frequent at first (often 2×/week), then weekly, then less often as things stabilize.</li>
  <li><strong>Before-dose labs:</strong> if your team asks for a “trough,” have blood drawn <em>before</em> your morning dose.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Incision, pain, and activity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep the incision clean/dry; pat dry after showers. Watch for spreading redness, drainage, or odor.</li>
  <li>Use stool softeners with narcotics; transition to acetaminophen if approved. Avoid NSAIDs unless your team says otherwise.</li>
  <li>No lifting > 10–15 lbs and avoid core-straining moves until cleared. Drive only when off narcotics and you can brake/turn safely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Food, fluids, and sleep</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Hydrate steadily unless told otherwise. Aim for pale yellow urine.</li>
  <li>Balanced meals; limit salt to help blood pressure. If food tastes “off,” small frequent meals are fine.</li>
  <li>Some anti-rejection meds interact with certain citrus (e.g., grapefruit). Ask your pharmacist what to avoid.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to call</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Call your team now:</strong> fever &gt; 101°F, vomiting that prevents meds, new/worsening swelling at the incision, urine output dropping, new leg swelling or calf pain.</li>
  <li><strong>Call 911 / go to ER:</strong> severe chest pain, trouble breathing, severe bleeding, confusion, inability to wake/stay awake.</li>
</ul>

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong> What’s my activity limit and for how long? When can I return to work or driving? Which symptoms should trigger an urgent call vs. a message?</p>
