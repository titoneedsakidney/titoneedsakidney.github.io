<h1>Social Worker</h1>

<h2>Short Description</h2>
<p>
  The social worker supports your mental health, caregiver plan, work/benefits paperwork,
  and practical hurdles so recovery and follow-up stay on track.
</p>

<h2>Main Priorities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Build a realistic caregiver plan (rides, home help, backups, respite options).</li>
  <li>Guide work, school, and benefits paperwork (FMLA, disability, return-to-work notes).</li>
  <li>Connect you to resources for transportation, lodging, medication costs, and community support.</li>
  <li>Assess stress, anxiety, mood changes, sleep, and coping; arrange counseling referrals when needed.</li>
  <li>Problem-solve barriers to adherence (childcare, schedules, housing/food insecurity).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issues They Work With</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Overwhelm, worry, low mood, or steroid-related mood shifts.</li>
  <li>Caregiver fatigue, family strain, or limited support at home.</li>
  <li>Paperwork deadlines, employer communication, or school accommodations.</li>
  <li>Financial stress affecting meds, labs, or visits; transportation/childcare gaps.</li>
  <li>Substance use concerns; linkage to appropriate treatment if needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Go to Them</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Any time stress or logistics make it hard to take meds, get labs, or keep appointments.</li>
  <li>When forms, letters, or benefits decisions are due or confusing.</li>
  <li>After a job/insurance change, move, or major family change.</li>
  <li>If your caregiver is struggling or you need a backup plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Come prepared:</strong> forms, deadlines, employer/insurer contacts, and your clinic’s medical record number.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What They Don’t Handle (Boundaries)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Medical diagnosis or medication dosing — that’s your clinical team.</li>
  <li>Legal or financial decisions — they can refer/advocate but don’t provide legal advice or set coverage rules.</li>
  <li>Emergency/crisis response — use your center’s urgent process or 911; they can help create a safety plan afterward.</li>
  <li>Long-term therapy — they connect you to ongoing counseling if needed.</li>
</ul>
