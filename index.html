    <h1>Welcome to Tito Needs a Kidney</h1>
    <p>This site is a living guide for people dealing with kidney failure, dialysis, transplant, or living donation — built from lived experience, not just theory.</p>

  <h2>About Tito</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a kidney transplant recipient who has been through dialysis, two transplants,
    and the long recovery process. This site is my way of sharing what I wish I had known—
    practical tips, honest stories, and resources for patients, donors, and families.
