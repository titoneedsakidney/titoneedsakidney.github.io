      <h2>Meet Tito</h2>
      <p>I’m Tito. I’ve been through dialysis, eight surgeries, and two kidney transplants. I’m also a wine judge, a transplant advocate, and someone who refuses to give up.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re navigating kidney disease, supporting someone who is, or curious about living donation — this site is for you.</p>
