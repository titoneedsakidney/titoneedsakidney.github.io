    <h1>Tito Needs a Kidney (The Book)</h1>

    <p><strong>“Tito Needs a Kidney”</strong> is a firsthand account of what it’s really like to survive kidney failure — told with clarity, honesty, and a refusal to sugarcoat what matters.</p>

    <p>The book covers:
      <ul>
        <li>What dialysis actually feels like</li>
        <li>What it means to lose your independence and fight to get it back</li>
        <li>How transplant really works (and what people often get wrong)</li>
        <li>Why the donor process is confusing — and how to make it better</li>
        <li>How one guy navigated it all without giving up on living fully</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>This book is for:
      <ul>
        <li>People on dialysis or newly diagnosed with kidney disease</li>
        <li>Donors who want to understand the whole picture</li>
        <li>Families who want to help but don’t know how</li>
        <li>Anyone who needs to see what hope actually looks like in practice</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
