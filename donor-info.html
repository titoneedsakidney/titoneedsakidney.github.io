      <h2>Life Expectancy</h2>
      <p>
        Donating a kidney is major surgery but has not been shown to reduce the donor’s life expectancy. Interestingly, people who have donated a kidney outlive the average person. 
        (<a href="https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/Fulltext/1997/10150/Living_donor_nephrectomy__renal_function_in_living.21.aspx" target="_blank">Fehrman-Ekholm, 1997</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        Some experts attribute this to selection bias—only healthy individuals are approved to donate. Others believe the positive emotional effects of donation may contribute to better health.

    <section id="surgical-complications">
      <h2>Surgical Complications</h2>
      <p>
        Donors may experience short-term post-operative issues such as bleeding, infection, or fever. These complications are usually minor and treated with standard medical care.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="recovery-time">
      <h2>Recovery Time</h2>
      <p>
        Kidney removal is typically done laparoscopically. Most donors go home within 1–2 days and return to work in 1–4 weeks depending on their job. Non-laparoscopic surgery has a longer recovery.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mortality-rate">
      <h2>Mortality Rate</h2>
      <p>
        The mortality rate for living kidney donation is 0.007%, or 7 deaths per 100,000 surgeries. For comparison, the U.S. infant mortality rate in 2019 was 558 per 100,000—80 times higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        Risk may be lower at Donor Care Network Centers of Excellence.
      </p>

    <section id="long-term-outcomes">
      <h2>Long-Term Outcomes</h2>
      <p>
        Kidney donation does not reduce life expectancy, but research shows a small increase in lifetime kidney failure risk compared to healthy non-donors.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>General population: 1 in 30</li>
        <li>Donors: 1 in 110</li>
        <li>Healthy non-donors: 1 in 700</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The increased risk is due to the fact that donors only have one kidney—but the absolute risk remains low.

    <section id="automatic-exclusions">
      <h2>Automatic Exclusions</h2>
      <p>Donors are typically excluded if they have:</p>
